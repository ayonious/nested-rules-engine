## Synopsis

A simple Decision tree based Rule Engine described using json files. Rules are executed according to decision tree. Create a set of rules (make them nested as you like) and based on set of inputs run the rules.

## Features

1. Rules expressed in huaman readable JSON
2. Create new set of inputs or change existing inputs as you traverse rules tree
3. Do multiple executions or rules set

## Installation

```
npm install nested-rules-engine --save
```

## Basic Example

```
const {executeEngine} = require('nested-rules-engine');

// Step1: Define your conditional rules
const rules = {
  "you_are_a_human": {
    "you_are_kind": "help_me_find_my_book",
    "you_are_smart": "please_do_my_homework",
  },
  "default": "please_do_my_homework"
};

// Step2: make set of inputs collection
const inputs = {
  "type" : "human",
  "kindnessLevel": 0,
  "intelligence": 10
}

// Step3: Make your custom Functions
const functions = {
  default : () => true,
  you_are_a_human: ({type}) => type === 'human',
  you_are_kind: ({kindnessLevel}) => kindnessLevel > 300,
  you_are_smart: ({intelligence}) => intelligence > 5,
  help_me_find_my_book: () => ({
    payload: 'lets help someone',
    effort: 'finding the book'
  }),
  please_do_my_homework: () => ({
    payload: 'doing homework',
    effort: 'im getting sick'
  })
};

// Step4: Execute Engine
const res = executeEngine(inputs, functions, rules);

// Output res:
/*
{
  result: { payload: 'doing homework', effort: 'im getting sick' },
  logs: []
}
*/
```

## Documentation

Engine Execution Signature:

```
executeEngine(variables, functions, rules, options);
```

### Inputs

- `variables` Collection of values on which rule engine will execute
  You can change these collection of variables (Add/Edit/Delte them) as you traverse the decision tree of rules.

- `functions` Collection of functions that decide which way the tree should be traversed.

  - In case the function indicates a final decision in tree (leaf of decision tree): Output can be anything that you want to see as `result`
  - In case the function is makes an intermediate decision (branch of decision tree):
    - if output is `true`: this means this branch should be traversed
    - else: the function will be executed

- `rules` Decision Tree that will be traversed by this Rule Engine

- `options` there are different options that you can provide to customize the execution nature
  - verbose (boolean): Makes Sure you get enough logs while engine goes through all decision tree
  - multiple (boolean): You can run multiple Decision Trees based on same inputs. Input sets are shared between each tree

### Outputs

- `result`: Result of the engine execution. format of Result will be defined by you through `functions`
- `logs`: Detailed logs while engine got executed (by default its disabled)

## Hard Examples

1. Example with verbose output, multiple executions [Find Here](https://github.com/ayonious/nested-rules-engine/blob/master/test/multirun-verbose-example.js)
2. Example with Creating new set of inputs while engine is executing [Find Here](https://github.com/ayonious/nested-rules-engine/blob/master/test/change-variables-example.js)
